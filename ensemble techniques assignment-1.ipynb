    "How Bootstrap Works:\n",
    "Bootstrap is a resampling technique that allows the estimation of the sampling distribution of a statistic by repeatedly resampling from the observed data with replacement. The key idea is to simulate multiple datasets that resemble the original dataset to infer properties of the underlying population or the sampling distribution of a statistic.\n",

    "Steps Involved in Bootstrap:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with a dataset containing \n",

    "n observations, where \n",
    "�\n",
    "n is the size of the original sample.\n",
    "Resampling with Replacement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly select \n",
    "�\n",
    "n observations from the dataset with replacement. This means that an observation can be selected multiple times or not at all in each iteration.\n",
    "This resampling process creates a bootstrap sample, which may differ from the original sample due to duplication or exclusion of certain observations.\n",
    "Statistic Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the statistic of interest (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) on the bootstrap sample. This step yields a single value of the statistic for that specific bootstrap sample.\n",
    "Repeat Steps 2-3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat the resampling and statistic calculation process a large number of times (e.g., B times), typically several thousand, to create a distribution of the statistic.\n",
    "Estimate Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the distribution of the calculated statistics. This distribution approximates the sampling distribution of the statistic.\n",
    "Confidence Interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct confidence intervals by determining percentiles of the bootstrap distribution. Common choices include the 95% or 99% confidence level.\n",
    "Statistical Inference:\n",
    "\n",
    "Make statistical inferences based on the properties of the bootstrap distribution. For example, if you are interested in estimating the mean, the mean of the bootstrap distribution can serve as an estimate, and the confidence interval provides a range of plausible values.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",

    "Interpret the results and draw conclusions about the population parameter or the uncertainty associated with the statistic of interest.\n",
